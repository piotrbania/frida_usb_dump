# frida_usb_dump
Frida script that allows to sniff USB traffic on macOS.

I've used this script to dump and investigate the checkm8 jailbreak back in the day. It dumps the data to DUMP_FILE_PATH with some additional ascii markers for further parsing.
The OFFSETS_* were dumped on macos bigsur as far as i recall.
